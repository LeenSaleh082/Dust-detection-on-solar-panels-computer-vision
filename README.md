# Problem statement 
Solar panels located in desert regions and on rooftops are prone to accumulating dust and dirt, resulting in a notable 30% decrease in efficiency. The manual inspection and cleaning of these panels are indeed difficult and costly, as it involves significant time and labor to clean each panel individually. This obstacle presents a considerable challenge for the solar energy sector in maintaining the cleanliness and optimal performance of solar panels.

# Tools 
Programming language : Python 
Google Colab
OS , Numpy , 
Keras , Pandas .

# Data Description
The dataset comprises images categorized into two classes for the purpose of classification: clean solar panels and dirty solar panels. The goal of this dataset is to develop a model that can accurately differentiate between clean solar panels and dirty ones.
